- Material: Paper clay

HE STARES YOU INTO THE SOUL...<br>
<br>
As said, first time handling a clay of any kind after the middle school<br>
<br>
Some points learned:
- When connecting two parts apply water enough. His left ear fell off during sandpapering and I had to buy an adhesive.
- When using the adhesive keep it away from the monitor. My secondary monitory got some irremovable spots. At least it's a really old and thick 1080p monitor that was made in 2009 and doesn't even have a HDMI port. Also that monitor cannot show proper colors and render everything reddish (I tried to calibrate it)
- When applying the adhesive wear gloves. It stuck my thumb and my forth finger for good 15 minutes. I tried olive oil, acetone, and the bloody mayonaise
- When coloring it mix the paint with some white color. I used the pure magenta color and it looked like that he just took a bloodbath.
- Also before applying any color paint it white first. The paper clay melts when you paint it first.

Btw I like how lo-fi this camera produces<br>
