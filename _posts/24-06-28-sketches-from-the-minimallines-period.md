I planned this during the mass in the church. Used three fingers -- using dactyls -- to compose 3x3 comics.

Yeah, it be okay.

One thing I want to mention -- albeit this isn't the best place for it -- is that the feeling I expressed in [Morenothing -3-](/morenothing/3) has been neutralized. At least some parts of that -- the part that I felt *the psychiatrist* didn't took me seriously -- yeah -- that really is not of truth -- but I still don't understand why they can't diagnose me yet -- I guess it's not really with her, 'tis the system -- **I'm sorry for these messy phrasings, it's past the midnight now and I can't get myself straight.** *I just spent what two hours doing nothing when I should've drawn and doing this recap to well, -- I'm trying to review (this is too obvious) -- yeah, so that I can "use" (I can't think of the proper words right now) for the future drawings. Ah yeah I drank some but it was not too much. I recently had a mental breakdown over some stupidest thing -- or, to phrase differently, I hadn't had mental breakdown except for recent a few days! That's a good thing, yeah, it be okay. I'll upload my really old drawings -- those drawn before [my first uploaded art](/withcolor/240203-depressing-place) -- they were drawn right after I kinda could draw some lines -- I wrote something like "I can draw lines now" and more, that I can't remember it right now -- they are well at least raw. After uploading the first drawing they were forgotten -- actively -- because I thought they were lesser. After drawing the first "minimallines" drawing -- that is [Schramble -1-](/schramble/1) -- those "withcolor" arts met the same fate too -- that's why the "withcolor" page is hidden in this website -- but thinking again they too say about me -- reveiewing them I feel that something still iterate -- btw I'm using the subj mood -- so I thought it can be helpful if I can cumulate them to the present -- & the future. Thiking again my artstyle kept chaging every time I had breakdowns, the theme that iterates in the whole [Schramble](/schramble) series. I don't know how to finish this paragraph...*

## Sketch of [Schramble -6-](/schramble/6)
*24.04.11*

Oh, the station...

It was weeks ago, I was riding my bike like any day. And the road happened to meet that station, but from a new side. When I first visited there I was walking (or riding? yeah, riding) from the rural site, and what I saw was one of the most soulless -- ABSURDLY! It was as if it was made malevolently to mock ~~us~~ me. So, uh, that gave me a lasting impression. So I drew my first uploaded art -- yeah, that is [Depressing Place](/withcolor/240203-depressing-place)! The description says that I walked along it... Ah yeah, it was really a long walk. The apartments behind them still are absurd. But this is not the main topic of this paragraph. That walk was in February -- that is almost 5 months ago. This paragraph started with the an episode that happened weeks ago... So I reached that station, and I was expecting that soullessness. To digress, I actively seek the soulless places. I think I expressed this once in the Schramble -- maybe 'cause I feel like that can help me find my place of this world -- or lack thereof. Am I understood? Anyway -- but I saw the lively people in lively stores. How? Well, that was in the back of the buildings. NOT the "most absurdly soulless buliding" I mentioned, that did not had the back side -- but the *other* soulless buildings, they had back sides. That at least gave me another impressions. But I can still hate that station, *that* building itself is an enough reason for that, and the *other* soulless buildings can't be indulged either...

## The PFP
*24.04.13*
![/imgs_sketches/240413_newpfp3_earupdated.png](/imgs_sketches/240413_newpfp3_earupdated.png)

The PFP I'm still using in the most sites. It was taken from [God Defends This Machine](/comics/240401-god-defends-this-machine). BTW that comic was the first time *the magenta character* from Scramble became my OC. AH! Also. At first his ears were the opposite. They were only "fixed" after [Schramble -5-](/schramble/5).

## An alterative version of [24.04.26-wine-into-my-coffee](/comics/240426-24-04-26-wine-into-my-coffee)
*24.04.27*
![/imgs_sketches/240427_24.04.26._wine_into_my_coffee_coloralt.png](/imgs_sketches/240427_24.04.26._wine_into_my_coffee_coloralt.png)

Well this edit was made *after* the published one! It's just de-colored version, with an exception of the last panel. I think this version looks better because it shows better that the last panel is the *conclusion*. Hmm. I don't know... Anyway, after this one I don't color (that is, use the fill bucket tool) the comics anymore.

Oh the other one -- I had several ideas kept to draw, and one of them is similar to this. The clock framework. But this time it'd be actual clock showing the hours. Around them are the vital meter showing how much I am awake, which is activated by caffeine and alcohol -- but alcohol would tremble the line. And in the part where I'd sleep there would be *someone* -- that is, as usual, a white circle with vertical eyes -- saying something like this: "Do you think this would make you interesting? Look at you. What a sad and boring life.". (The point was intentional) And yeah the *"caffeine alcohol clock"* in [Lac Illustrandum](/comics/240514-lac-illustrandum) was this one. But this was scrapped after being delayed by, as usual, a mental breakdown. I actually can't remember what was that one. So the outdated ideas can't be realized, [but some ideas last forever.](https://kamnosta.net/illusts/240624-heart-2-with-my-body-unminded)

## Sketch of [Meowch!](/illusts/240504-meowch)

![/imgs_sketches/240503_meouch_s1.png](/imgs_sketches/240503_meouch_s1.png)

Topics like this come up while riding the bike! And lo the attempt at shading that didn't last!

## Sketch of [Schramble -10-](/schramble/10)
*24.05.11*
![/imgs_sketches/240511_sr10_s0.png](/imgs_sketches/240511_sr10_s0.png)

This one originally had much different diaglogues in the initial sketch, but it couldn't be included.

![/imgs_sketches/240524_the_exam_is_over_today_FORICO.png](/imgs_sketches/240524_the_exam_is_over_today_FORICO.png)

Mm! This was taken from [The Exam Is Over Today](/illusts/240424-the-exam-is-over-today). Note the coloring fuckup in the original drawing.
"Now I can waste my time freely"? I always waste my time!

## Sketch of [L'heure viendra](/illusts/240602-l-heure-viendra)
*24.05.31*
![/imgs_sketches/240531_graben_s0.png](/imgs_sketches/240531_graben_s0.png)

Ah, this is my favorite drawing from this period! Along with [Des larmes furtives](/illusts/240506-des-larmes-furtives).
The motif is from Liszt's lied, *"O lieb, so lang du lieben kannst"*, with the lyrics written by Ferdinand Freiligrath.
This is also famous for its piano arrangement, *Liebesträume No. 3*.

```
O lieb’, so lang du lieben kannst!
O lieb’, so lang du lieben magst!
Die Stunde kommt, die Stunde kommt,
Wo du an Gräbern stehst und klagst!

Dann kniest du nieder an der Gruft
Und birgst die Augen, trüb und naß,
– Sie sehn den Andern nimmermehr –
Ins lange, feuchte Kirchhofsgras.

Und sprichst: O schau’ auf mich herab,
Der hier an deinem Grabe weint!
Vergib, daß ich gekränkt dich hab’!
O Gott, es war nicht bös gemeint!

Er aber sieht und hört dich nicht,
Kommt nicht, daß du ihn froh umfängst;
Der Mund, der oft dich küßte, spricht
Nie wieder: Ich vergab dir längst!

Er that’s, vergab dir lange schon,
Doch manche heiße Träne fiel
Um dich und um dein herbes Wort –
Doch still – er ruht, er ist am Ziel!

O lieb’, so lang du lieben kannst!
O lieb’, so lang du lieben magst!
Die Stunde kommt, die Stunde kommt,
Wo du an Gräbern stehst und klagst!
```

Speaking of which! The motif of [Des larmes furtives](/illusts/240506-des-larmes-furtives) is *Una furtiva lagrima*, especially the Pavarotti's interpretation. And the motif of [Meaningless 3 Suns, or the Last Two Songs](/illusts/240501-meaningless-3-suns-or-the-last-two-songs), which I claimed to be meaningless, is the last two songs of Schubert's *Winterreise*, that is: *Die Nebensonnen* and *Der Leiermann*!
```
Ach, meine Sonnen seid ihr nicht!
```

Speaking of Schubert, one of my favorites is the *Harfenspieler* songs, all three of them. I'll reference them later, so listen to it. Yes, you have to. Listen to the Dieskau's.

I'd like to quote them all, but for the sake of the space:
```
Ja, laßt mich meiner Qual!
Und kann ich nur einmal
Recht einsam seyn,
Dann bin ich nicht allein.

...

So überschleicht bei Tag und Nacht
Mich Einsamen die Pein,
Mich Einsamen die Qual.
Ach werd ich erst einmal
Einsam in Grabe seyn,
Da läßt sie mich allein!

...

Und ich weiß nicht was er weint.

...

Denn alle Schuld rächt sich auf Erden.
```

SPEAKING OF WHICH! The motif of [Whither Wanderest Thou](/withcolor/240204-whither-wanderest-thou) is *Jägers Abendlied*. The album cover referenced is *Schubert: Goethe-Lieder*, performed by, again, Dieskau.

```
Im Felde schleich’ ich still und wild,
Gespannt mein Feuerrohr.
Da schwebt so licht dein liebes Bild,
Dein süßes Bild mir vor.

Du wandelst jetzt wohl still und mild
Durch Feld und liebes Tal,
Und ach, mein schnell verrauschend Bild,
Stellt sich dir’s nicht einmal?

Des Menschen, der die Welt durchstreift
Voll Unmut und Verdruß,
Nach Osten und nach Westen schweift,
Weil er dich lassen muß.

Mir ist es, denk ich nur an dich,
Als in den Mond zu seh’n;
Ein stiller Friede kommt auf mich,
Weiß nicht, wie mir geschehn.
```

Oh God! I remember the emotion I felt after I finished this piece!
I meant the drawings, but it applies to the music too.

## Sketch of [Heart #1](/illusts/240610-heart-1)
*24.06.08*
![/imgs_sketches/240608_heart_and_spiders_s02.png](/imgs_sketches/240608_heart_and_spiders_s02.png)

Yes! This too is great. He was intentionally drawn doll-like.

## Early sketch of [Heart #2: With My Body Unminded](/illusts/240624-heart-2-with-my-body-unminded)
*24.06.11*
![/imgs_sketches/240611_violin_s2.png](/imgs_sketches/240611_violin_s2.png)

As said, should've been done right after Heart #1. BTW the pun in the title was not intended.

Well that took longer than I expected!
