Drew this while being depressed

## Addendum
*24.07.01*

This piece was uploaded in March 2024, after [What Would Stay](/withcolor/240316-what-would-stay) and before [Drunk to Drown](/withcolor/240327-drunk-to-drown), which are the last and the darkest *Withcolor* pieces, then deleted days later.
It was taken down because 1. maybe I then thought it recalls the blue oppresive feelings too much, and 2. while it being SFW, it may be misunderstood that it be drawn with pornographic intent.

The motif was taken from a fine art that is hanged up in a wall of my uni, which resonated me. It abstractively depited a city, intercrossed with yellow lines that signifies roads. Above them were dogs doing human activities, as walking, fighting, and mating. It impressed me so I tried to imitate a part of it, the last one.

The completed piece conveyed frustration and helpless emptiness that animalistic instincts could not solve. From the artstyle perpective this is more close to *minimallines* period, moreso than the next piece, demonstrated by CYMK simple lines, emptiness conveyed black background and inside, minimalistic linearts, and abstract backgrounds. It had the window-pattern background -- inspired by the [*"the oppressing monoliths that signifies that my house is near"*](/schramble/15)  -- which would continue to be used in the next period.

After its estrangement it had been forgotten, save for a minor reference in [Schramble -9-](/schramble/9). But considering the piece itself cannot be controversial and it shows the continuity of the period, omitting this piece felt to be not of justice. Thus I put this page here.
